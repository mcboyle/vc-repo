## Context

**Project context.** I maintain a private fork of VeraCrypt 1.26.29 that hardens *key derivation*.
Core architecture: an extra secret is mixed into the password **before** PBKDF2/Argon2, using
VeraCrypt's own keyfile pool method (a rolling CRC-32 accumulated into a 128-byte pool by modular
addition, then `password[i] += pool[i]`). Because of this, added factors require **no on-disk header
change**. Already built and verified: BLAKE2b-512 and SHA3-512 PRFs; a hardware-factor module
(YubiKey HMAC-SHA1, FIDO2 hmac-secret, and a raw-secret backend); constant-time Shamir M-of-N
threshold sharing over GF(2⁸); a factor-gated decoy (the outer volume opens with the password alone,
the hidden volume additionally requires the factor); multiple keyslots with anti-forensic splitting;
cross-platform key scrubbing; a non-destructive duress dismount; explicit Argon2id parameters; and
proof-of-concept implementations of write-only ORAM, threshold-OPRF, McCallum–Relyea network
binding, Merkle integrity, and an ML-KEM hybrid combiner. Constraints: every crypto change is
verified twice (against an independent reference implementation *and* against real compiled
objects); features are compile-time gated so a default build stays byte-for-byte stock; on-disk
format changes require explicit design review. Users are high-risk individuals (journalists,
activists) plus ordinary privacy-conscious people. **Scope boundary:** this is confidentiality,
integrity, access control, and deniable *storage*. It does **not** include tooling that fabricates a
false record of user activity to deceive forensic examination — permanently out of scope. Give me
the honest state of the art, including where a technique does **not** apply; a well-argued negative
result is a valuable outcome.

## Research question

Compare Tamarin, ProVerif, TLA+ and Alloy, and the verified-implementation projects (HACL*,
fiat-crypto, Vale) for use in a disk-encryption tool. I want to model a McCallum–Relyea network-binding
exchange and an OPRF exchange, proving secrecy and specifically the property "the server never learns
the key", and separately model a keyslot lifecycle state machine (add, open, rotate, revoke) to prove
no reachable state leaks a revoked key. Cover each tool's learning curve, what it can genuinely prove
versus what people claim it proves, and how to integrate verified primitive implementations behind a
stable internal API without rewriting everything. Also cover structure-aware and grammar-based fuzzing
for a binary on-disk format. *(Attach: `NETWORK-SHARE-SPEC.md`, `FORMAL-ANALYSIS.md`.)*

## Deliverable

Deliver: (a) a ranked shortlist of viable approaches with the strongest reference for each;
(b) concrete parameters/algorithms if I were to implement the top choice; (c) known attacks,
limitations and failure modes; (d) an explicit recommendation — including "don't do this" if that is
the honest answer; (e) full citations. Prefer peer-reviewed sources and IETF/NIST specs. Flag
anything unimplemented, withdrawn, or broken. Say clearly when the evidence is thin rather than
guessing, and distinguish what is deployed in production somewhere from what exists only on paper.
